In this instance, $B 0$ is selected as being n by n times the identity matrix, which is 1/8 times $B 0$. Since it makes a good place to begin the optimization process, the identity matrix is also adjusted to approximate the inverse Hessian matrix. This is due to the identity matrix's representation of the assumption of uniform curvature in all directions of the function, which makes sure that the BFGS technique starts with a stable approximation of the inverse Hessian even if the real inverse Hessian differs substantially."
